# Adatptive Global Food Supply Network

This repository contains code from the paper Baum, Laber, Bruckner, Yang, Thurner, Klimek (2024) Adaptive Shock Compensation in the Multilayer Network of Global Food Production and Trade
(https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03502) that was modified by Bas Valentin, Mair Lena Valentina, Rigler Julian and Silvestri Lorenzo in the course 25S 411.076 Quantitative Research Methods: Complex Systems Modelling KS by Andrew Ringsmuth at the University of Graz.

With the code adaptive_shock, you can run and save all possible shock scenarios in one go with the adaptation either switched on or off.

The code loss_calculations determines the relative losses, absolute losses and absolute losses per capita for any receiving sector (country x item) after indicating a shocked country in which each sector was shocked individually.

All necessary input for both codes, can be found in the folder /input.

In the folder /substitution, you find a summary of all substitution indexes as a table and visualized matrices for all subgroups, derived according to 4.4.5 Item substitutability.
